GlassFaceDetection

Soon to be GlassFaceRecognition

TODOs: Test functionality, better UI, more documentation

Cool features:
1) actually frees the camera. OpenCV documentation does not cover this.
2) CVLibTools -> converts OpenCV mats to JavaCV mats, still need testing
3) Merges OpenCV and JavaCV together
